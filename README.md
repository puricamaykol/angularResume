What's this about?
------------------

This Angular 4 app, features my résumé in material design. There's a component called resume: 

```html
    <resume></resume>
```

 This component makes use of these:

```html
	<profile></profile>
    <education></education>
    <languages></languages>
    <skills></skills>
    <jobs></jobs>
```

So as you can see, I've created a component for each section in my résumé. 

Just go around and take a look and check my github projects and linkedin,

The road ahead
--------------

 - Parse all data from an Object Literal
 - Allow the readers to switch between English and Spanish
 - Add Bar representing level of expertise to skills component
